## Sample Node Server with Sockets

### Branches
The **websockets** branch contains an example of a webpage hosted by a node.js server with express routing and a custom 404 error page.  It also has an example of how to make a websocket connection.

The **master** branch contains an example server that utilizes socket.io connections to emit stock data obtained from IEX API to it's connected clients

### Running the server
once node is installed, all that is required to run the server application is to type `./server.js` in the terminal when in the same directory as that file. This should work in a linux based environment, if it doesn't, the first line of code in the server.js file may need to be modified to point to where node is installed in your system.  or simply run `node server.js`
